  Same us last time, expand on the game with a twist of your own! You have 30 minutes, you can look up resources, and don't import new assets. Some examples:
  - Guards speed up on the return trip
  - Guards start moving randomly between waypoints on return trip
  - Guard vision is not a circle but a cone
  - Guards exhibit some different behavior based on level progress
